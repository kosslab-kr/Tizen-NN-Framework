# nnfw contrib

The `contrib` directory is basically a contribution channel where contributors can create a project
and start the code development.  The projects in the `contrib` directory may not be directly related
to `nnfw` but should have its own purpose that could augment the nnfw project.

If you are interested in proposing a new project, please create a pull request (PR) with a new
project directory under `contrib` including the description of proposing project.  The PR will be
reviewed by reviewers in `nnfw`, and the acceptance of new project will be determined based on the
PR reviews.
