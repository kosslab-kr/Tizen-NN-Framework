For faster communication and development, we organize workgroups (WGs) based on major topics
described in [#61](https://github.sec.samsung.net/STAR/nnfw/issues/61).  All WGs will work together
to achieve the goal of _nnfw_ project, but each WG will define its own tasks and milestones, set its
own sprints, and conduct its tasks.  All WGs will sync up through github (note that github is our
primary communication channel, and thus using github for communication is highly recommended) and
on/off-line meetings.

Current WGs based on the major topics in [#61](https://github.sec.samsung.net/STAR/nnfw/issues/61)
and their root issue links are as follows:

1. ML Framework (MLFW) WG
   - [Tasks and Milestones](https://github.sec.samsung.net/STAR/nnfw/issues/74)
2. NN Runtime (NNRT) WG
   - [Tasks and Milestones](https://github.sec.samsung.net/STAR/nnfw/issues/72)
3. NN API Operations (NNOP) WG
   - [Tasks and Milestones](https://github.sec.samsung.net/STAR/nnfw/issues/73)

If you would like to participate in any WGs above or create a new WG, please create an issue or
leave a comment at [#87](https://github.sec.samsung.net/STAR/nnfw/issues/87).
