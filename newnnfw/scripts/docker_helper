# Newly created files during docker run can have different ownership.
# This may cause some problems, for example, some jenkins slaves or developers
# can't remove built files due to lack of permission.
# To address this issue, let's change owner of all files and subdirector
# to owner of host directory.
#
# Parameters:
#  $1 : host directory
#  $2 : docker directory
#
# Requires following variables defined
#   DOCKER_RUN_OPTS, DOCKER_ENV_VARS, DOCKER_VOLUMES, DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME
